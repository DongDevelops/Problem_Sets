        <p>Right after finishing up my army duty in Korea, I stayed in San Francisco, US, for a year to learn English. It was an eye-opening experience and changed my life.
            Since I had never left Korea before that, I saw so many new things and met new type of people which in many ways shocked and amazed me.
        </p>
        <P>When I was in third year in the college, I applied for an exchange student to Spain because I met so many cool people from Spain in SF, so I wanted to live there for a while.
            I lived in La Coruna, Spain, studying Business with Spanish students. I also took some basic Spanish courses. At the end of my staying, I took a road trip to go around the entire Spain with two other friends.
            And after my road trip, I still had some time left in Spain. So I decided to do the The Camino de Santiago(the Way of St. James), walking the ancient pilgrim routes.
            It was very hard physically, but I needed some time to think upon my life, and I thought this was the best for that. It didn't really give me solution for my life, but it was a new experience and met some cool people there. Also, the view on the journey is amazing.
        </P>
        <p>As I also mentioned in Career tab, I lived in Sydney, Australia for a year with a working holiday visa. It was about my last year to apply for this visa, and I wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about the world.
            I didn't have much money when I got there, so I had to get a job quickly. My only skill at that time being English didn't help me so much with job hunting since everyone speaks English there.
            Hired in a Italian restaurant, I worked with people from different countries, serving food. It's always refreshing and fun to make friends from other countries and such an inspiring experience.
