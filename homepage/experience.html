        <h1>This is my experience!</h1>

        <p>Right after finishing up my army duty in Korea, I stayed in San Francisco, US, for a year to learn English. It was an eye-opening experience and changed my life.
            Since I had never left Korea before that, I saw so many new things and met new type of people which in many ways shocked and amazed me.
        </p>
        <P>When I was in third year in the college, I applied for an exchange student to Spain because I met so many cool people from Spain in SF, so I wanted to live there for a while.
            I lived in La Coruna, Spain, studying Business with Spanish students. I also took some basic Spanish courses.
