        <h1>This is my career!</h1>

        <p>My career started in one of the major companies in Korea called Daewoo ENC. It's a construction company that has many overseas construction projects.
            I worked in Overseas Risk Management Team, collecting data using different channels, analyzing the risk, and informing the employees based in the relative region.
            It was a high-paying job for somebody fresh out of college, but it wasn't what I wanted and I felt like I was wasting my time.
            I had such a little control and power over my work since it was a big company. It was just following orders and so many unnecessary paper works. For me, it wasn't worth my time.
            This thoughts stressed me out and influenced me in a bad way for my physical and mental health. So I decided to quit.
        </p>
        <p>I went back to my hometown, grabbingg some part time jobs here and there, spending most of my time thinking about what I want to do with my life.
            I couldn't figure it out for about a year, so I decided to go to Australia for a year to expose myself to new environment, hoping to be inspired from something.
            I worked in an Italian restaurant as a server for the most parts, and came back to Korea.
        </p>
        <p>I studied English intensely for about 6 months at home to be a translator. After that, I got hired in a software company, starting my career as a translator.
            I liked my work and my job, so I wored hard. I worked in 4 different organizations including government institutes. After about 4 years in this field, I realized the limit.
            I saw a limit as to how much I can go up as a translator, and the market was quite small that I realized soley relying on it wouldn't work for me and for my future with my family.
            Then, I remembered people telling me about coding, how prospective it is and all that. And at that time, coincidentally I was hired from a Korean company to do a simultaneous translation for Google's 10 weeks program.
            And all those apps different companies developed looked so cool and it motivated me to learn coding, thinking one day, I will be able to make one of my own too.
        </p>
        <p>I searched about different courses I can take as a beginner in coding, and I found this amazing lecture from Harvard University. So I took this course right away.
            It is definitely very challenging, and sometimes even makes me doubtful about my decision to take on this new challenge, but also very exciting to get to know new things and skills that I thought I would never understand about.
        </p>
        <p>Even though my salary kept going down as I change my careers, and will be even lower since I will have to start from the beginning again. But I don't regret. It's exciting and fun.
            If I stayed in any previous jobs because it was stable, probably I would have saved up more money, but I don't think I would have been this happy. I'm looking forward to learning more and one day, making my own program.
        </p>
