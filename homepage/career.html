        <h1>This is my career!</h1>

        <p>My career started in one of the major companies in Korea called Daewoo ENC. It's a construction company that has many overseas construction projects.
            I worked in Overseas Risk Management Team, collecting data using different channels, analyzing the risk, and informing the employees based in the relative region.
        </p>
        <p>It was a high-paying job for somebody fresh out of a college, </p>
