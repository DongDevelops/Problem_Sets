        <h1>This is my career!</h1>

        <p>My career started in one of the major companies in Korea called Daewoo ENC. It's a construction company that has many overseas construction projects.
            I worked in Overseas Risk Management Team, collecting data using different channels, analyzing the risk, and informing the employees based in the relative region.
            It was a high-paying job for somebody fresh out of college, but it wasn't what I wanted and I felt like I was wasting my time.
            This thoughts stressed me out and influenced me in a bad way for my physical and mental health. So I decided to quit.
        </p>
        <p>I went back to my hometown, grabbingg some part time jobs here and there, spending most of my time thinking about what I want to do with my life.
            I couldn't figure it out for about a year, so I decided to go to Australia for a year to expose myself to new environment, hoping to be inspired from something.
            I worked in an Italian restaurant as a server for the most parts, and came back to Korea.
        </p>
        <p>I studied English intensely for about 6 months at home to be a translator. After that, I got hired in a software company, starting my career as a translator.
            I liked my work and my job, so I wored hard. I worked in 4 different organizations including government institutes. After about 4 years in this field, I realized the limit.
            With this job, I saw a limit as to how much I couldn't really the future
