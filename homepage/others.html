        <p>I'm going to share some parts of my life that people seem to find interesting!
        </p>
        <p>I'm married to my wife who is American. We met through Tinder in Sejong, Korea. She was already in Korea, teaching English in an academy
            and I lived nearby,  and two dogs.</p>
