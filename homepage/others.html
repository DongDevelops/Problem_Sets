        <h1>These are other parts of my life!</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>I'm going to share some parts of my life that people seem to find interesting!
        </p>
        <p>I'm married to my wife who is American. We met through Tinder in Sejong, Korea. She was already in Korea, teaching English in an academy
            and I lived nearby, and wanted to make a foreigner friend to practice English. And I met her, we clicked. After 2 years of dating, we married.
            We have very different upbringings and opinions about things, so it sometimes causes troubles but also makes life dynamic and fun.
        </p>
        <p>I have two dogs, both Sapsali, Korean breed. We were only going to have one dog, so adopted Colonel from an animal shelter, but then he looked bored at home,
            so we decided to adopt another one for him to have a friend. Our second dog's name Millie. They are both anxious dogs. They are cute, smart, and have good traits, but also very annoying sometimes.
            Millie is very smart, and she likes watching TV which is so weird. Colonel is such a soft and gentle dog, but weirdly other dogs always seems to be annoyed by him for some reasons.
            We want to adopt a cat in a near future because they look so peaceful and calm which we love.
        </p>
        <p>Last one might not sound so special, but in Korea at least, it's unusual I think, because everyone I talked to was very surprised whenever I bring this up.
            We live in Korea, but not in a big city like Seoul. We are in a countryside called Gurye. It's located in the southern part, and well known for one of the highest mountains in Korea
            and beautiful hiking courses with nature. It's so country that you need a car to get a coffee, and the average age of this town is around 75.
            Before moving here, we were in a big city, and kind of got tired of it. We always tried to escape to nature every weekend. So, we decided to live in a countryside for few years.
            We like it so far except that we can't order food delivery. But since I had never lived in a country like this, it's very refreshing and just nice to walk out the door to be surrounded by nature.
            Hopefully, our experience here will remain good until the end!
